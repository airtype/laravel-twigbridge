### Laravel 4 TwigBridge

## Very alpha, if you need to use Twig in production, use https://github.com/rcrowe/TwigBridge

Trying out some different things, to match the Silex ServiceProvider more closely (same container bindings etc). Als basic filter/function helpers for Laravel and possibility to call Facades.
